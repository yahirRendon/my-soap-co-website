		<h2>Documentation of the Development Process</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			Introducing MY Soap Co. to a larger audience as well as sustaining the current clientele is the intent and purpose behind this website.  New products, promotions, and current inventory can be displayed to visitors with corresponding and pertinent information. Furthermore, insights into the values of the company can be communicated to visitors through content and images. Before creating the website, careful consideration was given to establish and define the target market that is the leading consumer demographic for natural personal care products. This step insured that the design and content of the final product would engage the target audience while also reflecting the brand and style of MY Soap Co.

		<h2>Defense of the Final Product</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			A core principal of MY Soap Co. is simple and natural products with modern aesthetics. The design choices that were made in the website reflect this principal. Universal design choices that apply across the website are as follows: 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The color palette spans across the site and was selected around two important elements. The company logo was first designed, and a rich purple color was chosen to reflect the company logo. To accompany this bold color a forest green, light blues, and off-white colors were chosen to reflect the natural colors found in nature which inspire the ingredients used and products developed by MY Soap Co. These colors were used in background colors and as tinted overlays for images to create cohesion in the website and a consistent color palette.
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The typography of Roboto from Google Fonts was chosen to reflect a simple and modern design. Several font stylings were chosen to provide font variety as needed.  Narrower text for paragraphs and bolder text for headings. This creates easy to read text with a modern style throughout the site.
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The navigation bar which is central to using the website used a clean and modern display. The MY Soap Co. logo sits front and center to insure visitors know which site they are one. The use of dropdown menus in the navigation bar reduce clutter for the user and allow the imagery of the brand to stand out. The submenus are easily accessible upon hover. Furthermore, the responsiveness was added to the navigation bar allowing it to collapse on smaller screens to reduce clutter and further promote a simple design layout. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The footer section is connected to the navigation section throughout all the webpages creating visual cues to visitors regarding the beginning and ending of each page. The uniformity of the color palette, navigation area, footer section, and typography across the pages unites the website creating a memorable and cohesive user experience.
		</p>
		<H2>Individual page design choices are as follows:</H2>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The home page was designed to provide new and meaningful information from MY Soap Co. to new and current customers. Information is communicated to visitors via text as well as through the imagery used to express the style and aesthetic that is reflective of MY Soap Co.
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The new Shea Rose Soap product is introduced to visitors along with Gift Sets. Buttons that link the user to the appropriate pages allow the visitor to quickly find out more about products highlighted on the homepage. Giving is an important feature of MY Soap Co. and a section is provided to communicate this to users and inspire them to give to those they love with Gift Sets available. More useful information is communicated to the users about a key ingredient in one of the soap products, charcoal, along with audio for those that are more interested in listening as opposed to reading. A notification is provided about discounts to entice visitors about savings. Lastly, a section is provided inviting visitors to view the latest advertisement for MY Soap Co. which further communicates the values of the company to visitors. All this information is presented and amply spaced by taking advantage of the ease of vertical scrolling to ensure information is easily absorbed by visitors without feeling excessive.
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 This soap page was designed to provide important information to visitors about each type of soap available. The body of the page is divided into three sections for each type of soap. Appropriate colors from the color palette were chosen to further indicate to the user the elements that were connected in this section. Clarity in information and ingredients is important to MY Soap Co. as well as to the target audience so an image, description, and ingredients are displayed clear for the visitor. At the end of the body section a table summary is provided so visitors can quickly compare the soaps and their ideal use. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 This sets page follows a similar style as the soap page to insure cohesion in the page designs. Colors were similarly used to connect related elements. Information that is valued by the target audience is easily accessible to visitors. A similar summary table is provided so visitors can identify the appropriate gift set for themselves or a loved one. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The about page is subdivided into three sections to answer the critical components of the final project rubric. The banner with bold text easily distinguishes the elements of the rubric being addressed.
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			 The contact page is divided into two sections. The first section provides the address, phone, and hours of operation for the business. The second provides a simple form that can be completed for comments and/or questions. Colors are again used to separate sections along with bold banner text. These design choices serve to clearly identify relevant information to visitors.

		<h2>Opportunities for Improvement and Growth</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			 In the future the responsiveness of the website will further be developed to accommodate mobile phones. With more time, the contact input form will be connected to the server allowing for comments and questions to be sent to an email inbox and facilitate communication. With more time and resources creating a page or section that asks the user questions about their skin allowing for suggested products to be recommended would be beneficial. This would require further understanding of inputs and working with JavaScript to develop such a feature. Finally, with more resources creating an e-commerce checkout system would be the long-term goal allowing products to be sold to a wider audience.
