<h1 align="center">Mock Soap Company Website</h1>

<p align="center">
This is one of the first websites I created for a web design class back in 2018. I pushed myself at the time to create something above the basic criteria and looking back on it I am still pretty happy with it. I would refactor certain elements but the design and look still speaks to me. This is just a mock website for a soap making company. Something I may want to circle back to one day...
