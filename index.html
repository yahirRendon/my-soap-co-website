		<h2>Charcoal Benefits</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			Our active charcoal is sourced from coconut shells and is processed at very high temperatures to create activated charcoal that is more porous and has greater surface area than regular charcoal. The negative charge of activated charcoal allows for binding with positively charged toxins and pollutants. These toxins bind to the activated charcoal particles as opposed to your skin and are easily rinsed off. The skin is capable of absorbing and introducing toxins to the body which makes activated charcoal a great way to cleans and prevent toxins from absorbing into the body in the first place. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			Activated charcoal has many applications and is safe for topical use but can also be ingested. Furthermore, activated charcoal can be used to filter water, as an antidote to certain pharmaceutical overdoses, and as an aid to some cases of food poisoning. Discover more of the benefits by listening to Dr. Joel Axe below:

		<h2>For the Love of Giving</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			Even when the idea of MY Soap Co. was in its infancy the importance of giving back was integral to the founding of MY Soap Co. While many discussion were had between the founders, Miguel and Yvette, regarding the sustainability, purity of ingredients, and profit so were discussions about giving back. In the eyes of Miguel and Yvette, a company that doesn’t give back is not worthy of receiving in the first place. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			The necessity of giving back was cemented in the founders after a trip to Mexico years before dreams of starting a company were ever dreamt. While visiting the beautiful city of Veracruz the founders were invited to dinner by a local family. Upon entering their home, the signs of a simple life were apparent and after a few moments so was the abundance of love, laughter, and joy. After a wonderful meal over stories, music and uncontrollable laughter Miguel and Yvette offered to clean and wash dishes. Despite the heavy push back from their hosts Yvette insisted and they were finely allowed to play a role in the cleaning process. As dishes and utensils were washed, dried, and returned to their rightful places it become obvious that cupboards were barren and the fridge was nearly empty. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			Upon leaving the home of their lovely hosts the significance of what Miguel and Yvette just experienced dawned on them. The hosts had offered their limited and perhaps last food supplies for who knew how long to guests they barely knew. Such willingness to give was moving beyond words and continues to serve as a permanent reminder of what it means to be human. To give not when it is easy but to give because one always can.  
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			MY Soap Co. is committed to giving back to their local community as well as to causes that have track records of elevating the human experience. Consider giving in your life with the new Gift Sets from MY Soap Co. 
		</p>
		<p class="para-text">
			“With your purchase, we are eternally grateful for your partnership in giving back together”<br>-Miguel and Yvette.
